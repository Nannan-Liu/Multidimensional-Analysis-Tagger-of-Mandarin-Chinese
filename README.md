# Multidimensional-Analysis-Tagger-of-Mandarin-Chinese

The Multidimensional Analysis Tagger of Mandarin Chinese (MulD Chinese) is a program that extends Biber's functional analysis of English (1988). Its point of departure is to study register variation and communicative effect of texts. The program tags 54 linguistic features based on ICTCLAS (H.-P. Zhang, Yu, Xiong, & Liu, 2003) and word lists in Chinese linguistics research. It performs statistical analysis to indicate 5 dimensions of register variation. The program plots the variation of the input text or corpus as against 15 registers in an upsampled ToRCH2014 corpus (http://114.251.154.212/cqp/torch09/, username: test, password: test). It also offers visualisation options using existing Python packages.

Referencing the tagger

To reference the tagger, please use the following:
Liu, N. 2019. Multidimensional Analysis Tagger of Mandarin Chinese. Available at: https://github.com/nnl93/Multidimensional-Analysis-Tagger-of-Mandarin-Chinese.

This program is based on the ICTCLAS, and it is advised to reference this Chinese tagger when MAT Chinese is used. Please refer to https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1119280.

Requirements 

This program requires Python to run (https://www.python.org/). The Python packages needed are NLTK (Bird, Loper, & Klein, 2009), Python wrapper of ICTCLAS â€“ PyNLPIR (https://pypi.org/project/PyNLPIR/), and Factor Analyzer (https://factor-analyzer.readthedocs.io/en/latest/factor_analyzer.html).
