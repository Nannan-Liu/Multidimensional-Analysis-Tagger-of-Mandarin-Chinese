# Multidimensional-Analysis-Tagger-of-Mandarin-Chinese

The Multidimensional Analysis Tagger of Mandarin Chinese (MulDi Chinese) is a programme that extends Biber's functional analysis of English (1988) to Mandarin Chinese. It aims to describe register variation and communicative effect of texts. The programme tags 54 linguistic features based on ICTCLAS (H.-P. Zhang, Yu, Xiong, & Liu, 2003) and word lists in Chinese linguistics research. It performs statistical analysis to output 5 dimensions of register variation. The programme plots the variation of the input text or corpus as against 15 registers in an upsampled ToRCH2014 corpus (http://114.251.154.212/cqp/torch09/, username: test, password: test). It also offers visualisation options using existing Python packages.
